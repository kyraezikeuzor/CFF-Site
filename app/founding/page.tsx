            In March 2022, two high school freshmen, Kyra Ezikeuzor and Blair Middleton, came up with an idea to bring computer science to kids in Houston. We wanted to show that learning to code can be fun, creative, and open to everyone.

          <p className="md:text-lg">
            Since we started, we&apos;ve run cohorts that have taught dozens of students how to code and build projects. Our programs are hands-on and focus on learning by doingâ€”no boring lectures, just creating cool stuff.

            With help from our community and supporters, we&apos;ve raised thousands of dollars to grow our programs. Every dollar goes toward reaching more kids and giving them the tools to succeed.
